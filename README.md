# backtester
backtesting app of mine, there were no app i can use in the way i want, so i decided to develop one for myself.

![plan](https://github.com/cemdusenkalkan/backtester/blob/main/backtester.png)

trying to find out how to best parameters in any dataset objectively, random or grid search doesnt work, random doesnt find it, grid cant because of complexity of searching
